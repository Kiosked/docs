# Kiosked Extensions Privacy Policy
> Kiosked's Privacy Policy for its browser extensions

This privacy policy details Kiosked's policies and behaviour surrounding the use of its browser extensions. Kiosked provides online advertising infrastructure with integrations for several 3rd party networks and providers. We at Kiosked take privacy matters very seriously and want you, the user, to understand what data may be collected and what yours and our responsibilities are when it comes to using our extensions.

## Kiosked's Data Processing Policy

Kiosked maintains an in-depth [DPP document](https://kiosked.com/data-processing-policy-dpp/) that details our processes when it comes to handling data.

Beyond our DPP, this extension **collects no personal data** from the user, either via tracking mechanisms or by prompts.

## Kiosked ads

Our extensions may provide ads using the Kiosked platform, and these ads (along with the system that creates them) are bound by [Kiosked's Privacy Policy statement](https://kiosked.com/privacy-policy/).

### 3rd-party ads

The user should be aware that by using our extensions, ads provided by 3rd party networks (often listed in our [`ads.txt`](https://kiosked.com/ads.txt)) may be shown on any page. These networks abide by their own privacy policies and data collection guidelines - it is the user's responsibility to understand these policies.

## Your responsibility as a user

By choosing to use our extensions you understand that ads shown while using said extensions may perform tracking or data collection as outlined in the relevant privacy policies and DPPs owned by the activated advertising networks.

### Sharing data from the extensions

Data exported from the extension does not contain personally-identifiable information contained within it, but it is entirely up to the user to ensure that this information is kept secure and not shared with unintended recipients.
