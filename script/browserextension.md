# Placement Configurator Tool

Kiosked Placement Configurator Tool helps you to create mockup's from our publisher pages. 

## How to use

Placement Configurator Tool is supported only in Chrome. It has built-in capability to block Kiosked production scripts when the extension is Enabled. 

When extension is running and you are on the page where you want to create a mockup, refresh the page before starting to do modifications.

Buttons of the extension.
Add button opens up a new configuration that can be set towards the page.
Enable enables the script in the extension to be run.
Save saves the configuration - this will be used later.
Selects help you to configure the ad-size and ad-type.
Bullet button helps you to set frequencies towards the placement. e.g for all similarly named p elements. Only one unit after a specific selector etc.
Options button lets you toggle off scaling and disclaimer from our placements.
X button lets you remove the whole configuration.

After adding a new configuration it's suggested to choose the element where we want to render our ad, that can be done by clicking the select-button and then choosing the element by hand from the page. 

After you have chosen the element where to put our ad unit, it is highly suggested to choose the ad-size, ad-type, bulletLanguage settings and possible scaling/disclaimer settings. 

When you have set all previous steps in place, you can enable the targeting box on left-side of the configuration and also Enable the running of the script from the main Enable button.

You can create multiple configurations before enabling them.
