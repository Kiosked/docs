# Publisher monetization script
> JavaScript client for publisher page monetization

The monetization script (or "client script") is a JavaScript client that is provided to publishers to inject into their webpages for the purpose of monetizing their content. 

The client script is a managed payload that is configured by Kiosked staff, being tailored for the publishers site. Many automatic optimization processes are performed behind the scenes with results fed to the publisher-unique scripts to improve yield and performance.
