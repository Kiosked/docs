> Dynamic monetization script that creates multiple ad placements per load

The dynamic monetization script is Kiosked's intelligent ad placement library that builds placements dynamically based upon injected configurations. Kiosked staff will tweak and update values internally that are reflected within the script itself - the amount of banners, their locations and their behaviours are just some of the many aspects that can be tweaked remotely.

Dynamic scripts offer a huge efficiency gain over [static tags](introduction_statictag.md) due to the fact that only one script load is required. Once loaded the dynamic script will proceed to create any number of configured ad placements.
