# Static tags
> Industry standard single-ad placement generation script

Static tags are simple scripts that create a single ad placement in the **same location that the `<script>` tag is placed**. They can be loaded many times per page, even using the same ID. The URL should not be modified before placement, and there is **no need for a cachebuser**.

## Placement

Static tags, as mentioned above, create ads exactly where they're placed. They should be placed within the `<body>` block in a location that is visible to the user and not obscured by any other element.

## Static vs Dynamic

The [dynamic script](script/introduction_dynamic.md) is a more lightweight and speedy alternative to static tags and is definitely the preferred method of monetization. Static tags are provided merely for compatibility reasons or when the top-frame of a webpage is not accessible.
