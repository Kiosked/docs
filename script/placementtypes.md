# Placement Types

> Kiosked's advertisements come in different categories, called placement types. Each ad located on a page is referred to as a placement, which can be configured to fit in to one of these categories.

## Placements vs. Placement Types

A placement is simply a box or instance where an advertisement is to be shown. It has a lot of complex logic behind it, but will appear to the user as an ad or banner. Placements themselves have little to no knowledge as to what _type_ they are.

A placement type controls how the placement is connected to the page, how it's shown and hidden, and how it behaves throughout its lifecycle.

## Types

There are only a handful of different placement types:

### In-Line

In-line placements are the most common type, with banners being presented within the content of the page. Banners are often shown in between paragraphs of text content, hence the name _in - line_.

In-line placements can be placed where content flows vertically, so that banners can be appended or prepended to elements. This type is also perfect for placing banners in sidebars.

### In-Media

In-media placements can _overlap_ and obscure containers or images, and are usually placed over the top of an image (covering the bottom). These placements usually have a close button that the user can use to close the banner so that the underlying content is fully visible again.

### In-Screen

The in-screen unit is attached to the screen border (adhesion unit). It can be moved around the screen using different configurations.

### Interstitial

Interstitial units are similar to in-screen placements, but they obscure the entire screen like with a modal dialog. Users will not be immediately able to use the page behind the unit, but can close the unit via a close button shortly after it's shown.
